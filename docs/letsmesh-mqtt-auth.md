# LetsMesh MQTT authentication (MeshCore)

mesh-client uses the same contract as [meshcore-mqtt-broker](https://github.com/michaelhart/meshcore-mqtt-broker): MQTT username `v1_<64-hex public key>` (uppercase) and a password produced by `@michaelhart/meshcore-decoder` `createAuthToken`.

## JWT audience (`aud`)

The broker validates that the token’s `aud` claim matches its configured `AUTH_EXPECTED_AUDIENCE` when that value is set.

For **LetsMesh public presets** (`mqtt-us-v1.letsmesh.net`, `mqtt-eu-v1.letsmesh.net`), mesh-client sets:

- **MQTT connect host/port**: the regional hostname and `443` (WebSocket TLS).
- **JWT `aud`**: `letsmesh.net` (apex), not the regional hostname.

That matches a common multi-region deployment pattern (one audience for all regional endpoints). If your operator documents a different `aud`, use **Custom** MQTT and paste a manually generated token, or adjust app behavior once the value is confirmed.

## Debugging connection vs auth

When investigating failures, use the **main process** log (not only the UI):

- **`[MeshcoreMqttAdapter] client error`** with “Not authorized” (or similar) **before** the 10s timeout usually indicates **rejected credentials or JWT** (signature, expiry, or `aud`).
- **Only** the timeout message (`no CONNACK/SUBACK within 10s`) with **no** preceding client error often points to **transport** (TLS/WebSocket stall, DNS, IPv6, firewall), not a validated MQTT session.

Meshtastic MQTT working on the same machine does not guarantee MeshCore LetsMesh will (different code path and broker), but it helps rule out total network outage.

## Manual token

Import identity under **Radio**, or set **Custom** and paste username `v1_<public key>` and a token from tooling that matches your broker’s `AUTH_EXPECTED_AUDIENCE`.
